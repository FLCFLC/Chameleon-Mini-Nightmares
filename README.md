# Chameleon-Mini-Nightmares
My first chameleon mini and i thought it would work straight out of the box, using the Chameleon APP from google play, WRONG.. Iv tried doing everything that https://hackerwarehouse.tv/product-knowledgebase/chameleon-mini/chameleon-mini-revg-rdv2-setup-in-linux-and-windows/    Said to do. I downloaded both zip files and extracted them as directed. Then came to putting the Chameleon into Bootloader mode. I hold down the button closest to the mini usb while plugging into computer, Waiting for the green lights to start flashing, in bootloader mode, and nothing happens. It wont go into bootloader mode. It shows up in devices &amp; printers. Iv clicked on properties and it sais its running normal, But i cant get it into bootloader mode to flash it. please can someone help me.
